# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
The **Diabetes Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters. It utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to deliver accurate predictions. The system is deployed using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and feature selection.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes model performance for better accuracy.
- **Web Interface**: Developed using Flask for easy user interaction.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Users can input health parameters to get immediate predictions.
- **Dataset Handling**: Uses Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model Training)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning, if applicable)
  - Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
  - Flask (Web Framework)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

## Usage
1. Open the web interface.
2. Enter the required health parameters (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, etc.).
3. Click the **Predict** button to get the result.
4. The system will display whether the person is likely to have diabetes.
<!--
## Dataset
The model is trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can replace it with another dataset if needed.
## Model Performance
- Achieved **X% accuracy** using [best-performing model].
- Evaluated using **confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Hyperparameter tuning was performed using **GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV**.
  -->
## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy using deep learning.
- Deploy as a cloud-based service (AWS/GCP/Heroku).
- Add more user-friendly visualizations and insights.
